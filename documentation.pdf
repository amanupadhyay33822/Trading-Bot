Trading Logic
Strategy
The bot uses a simple trading strategy with the following logic:

Buying Condition:

The bot buys shares if:
It holds no shares (holdings === 0).
The current price drops to 99% or less of the previous price (1% drop).
When buying, it spends its entire balance to purchase as many shares as possible.
Selling Condition:

The bot sells shares if:
It currently holds shares (holdings > 0).
The current price rises to 101% or more of the previous price (1% rise).
When selling, it calculates the total profit from the sale and updates the balance accordingly.
State Management
Balance: Initial amount of money the bot can use to buy stocks.
Holdings: The number of shares currently held by the bot.
Previous Price: The last stock price before the current price.
Total Profit: Cumulative profit from all trades made by the bot.
Trades: An array to keep a record of all buy and sell actions.
